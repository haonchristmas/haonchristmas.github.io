    <td>   Script 1.3 was easy enough when working as a team, and the use of swapping round             every few minutes made a difference to how quickly it was completed, as the process became slower, although it was good because we all got a turn to type and read.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>    we could lengthen the time spent on reading or typing, which would enable us to speed up as we could do one activity per script, this would increase efficiency greatly.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>    Next time I hope to reach script 1.4, and to do so I will put into practice, my new method of swapping places every script. Through doing this I may reach script 1.5. This will greatly improve how I work as it will enable me to do more in one lesson, thus, as well as saving time I will be able to learn more.</td>
