Unfortunately, as some readers may have realised, my blogs start at week 4, as opposed to 1. This was because, unfortunately, I suffered a serious concussion at the beginning of term. This means that it is not possible for me to write these blogs, for obvious reasons. I am otherwise up to date with my blogs.
