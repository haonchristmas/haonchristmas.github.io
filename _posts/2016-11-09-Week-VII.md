WEEK 7

The week was a break from our usual schedule, as we took some time to review our blogs. I have therefore made some changes to it. Those of you who read my blog may have noticed that my background has changed, my avatar has changed, and my blog's name has changed. I am still making amendments to my code, as I am trying to find the best look for it. I have been given the task of trying to raise my mark from the midsection (where I would have found myself previously) to what is hopefully the better, higher section, where I will get a better grade. However, do not be fooled! That is not the only reason for my improvement of my blog! I also want to make it look better, and I want a change. I hope to eventually reach a design I am pleased with, and keep hold of it.

That's all for this week, I’ll write again next wednesday, when i’ll have news from the lesson. Until then, 

**BYE**
