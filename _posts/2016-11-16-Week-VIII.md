(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

  <tr>
    <td>  We used our usual strategy to work, and it succeeded, again. However we did meet the issue of silliness on our way. This came around by the person typing being, well , irresponsible (for want of a better word) and this then led to a very 'interesting' script. Fortunately ( in this case) the script was deleted. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>  The only limit today was, as said before , our silliness. We will get over this by basically being very strict on each other.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>  We will keep building our coding abilities, and keep the previous rules ( in week 5 ) and implement new ones/ reinforce old ones. If this does not work, it may be the case that our group has to split up, though I am not yet willing to have that as a viable option. For now.</td>
