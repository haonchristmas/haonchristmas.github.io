Unfortunately, I was unable to attend this lesson for I had an illness. As far as I am aware, and if my partners are not lying to me, then , they did well in the lesson, and completed the final 3 scripts. This means we are now allowed to move on to the lights. With the lights, we have to program them to make patterns. However, I am told that we faced no issues this lesson, so, that is all.

NOAH
