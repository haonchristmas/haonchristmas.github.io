    <td>"It is really good to read the example above the instructions. If you read this, it does help with your interpretation of the instructions."

 I said this in a previous blog, and it still works, and helps me, every week. I have moved on to the next section in a well prepared manner, and am enjoying creating the PIG LATIN TRANSLATOR, which removes the first letter of the word, places it at the end, and then adds an 'AY' at the end. EG:

This is a screenshot of the ‘BIG IF’ which rendered me stuck, until I received an insight into the program. Admittedly, this insight came from a friend, as I realised that I was falling behind in class ( I was still on a low percentage ) and I needed to catch up. Therefore, what I need to work on is my resilience, when it comes to trial and error. Also, may I just point out the fact that the hint was COMPLETELY USELESS in this program.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>As said in the previous box, after about 20 minutes of trying, I need to keep going, and not ask for help. However, I did do the logical thing, and did, sensibly may I add, not resort to asking a teacher straight away. So actually, I think I did well, and don’t think that I am completely at a loss.
