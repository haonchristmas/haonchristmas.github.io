  <tr>
    <td>Today, my strategy was to remember all I had done previously, and to read the instructions and example CAREFULLY, like REALLY CAREFULLY. The reason I was able to increase 5% was because I finished the going on a holiday section. This was meticulous, and took a VERY long time to make. First you define loads of functions ( EG. PLANE_RIDE_COST("Los Angeles")) and then you add them together. Defining these was hard, but ultimately, putting them together was harder. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>In this lesson, I achieved quite a lot, and so am happy with the habits I used. I got stuck rarely, but when I did, I either dug myself out, or further down. When the latter occurred, I asked a friend.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will try less and less to use my friends as a source of answers, as it is good to review things, and I will have to at some point. If I could understand all the questions and exercises that were on the python coding codecademy section, then there would be no need for me to do it. I am fine with asking a friend, and my ego will not get in the way of it, so I am actually not willing to say that I wont ask a friend again.</td>
