    <td>Allow me a brief introduction. Repl is yet another code building program, like codecademy. Unlike codecademy, it does not offer instructions and is in python 3, not 2. Right. Today the task(s) was/were all created from scratch (not the website, the beginning!) and we had to make these do stuff. For example, we had to make one that told a joke, but waited for a reply before revealing the punchline. There was another which required the user to give a height and a width, so that the program could calculate the perimeter and area. As the smart readers will notice, the first was easier.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Over complicating things was the highest cause of error in today's lesson, much higher than anything else. What should have been a three line code (eg: print("banana")
                                                                                                 input()
                                                                                                 print(“apple”) ) became a 42 line piece of code trying to define the term print. The computer knows its stuff, just tell it what to do! </td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will it improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>As over complicating things was the problem, logically the only thing I can do to improve is to NOT over complicate things! It is very simple! This will help me by allowing me to see the problem, and know the solution, quicker and better!</td>
