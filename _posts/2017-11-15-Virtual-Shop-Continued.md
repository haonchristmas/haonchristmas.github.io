**Virtual Shop Continued**

**This used a culmination of vlookup,  python knowledge (eg. * = multiply), and general knowledge too. First we needed a list of the items that we were going to sell in our virtual and imaginary shop. Mine included dog soup, jumbo sausages and haggis. Then we needed to add the prices ( which meant that the jumbo sausages cost £4,000,000.00 obviously ). This is important because if there is no price to an object, you will not make any imaginary money, thus ending up imaginarily bankrupt, with imaginarily no jumbo sausage ( devastating!). So add the price, and then we needed to create a virtual till. I used three columns, each representing a factor in working out the price of the items the customer wants ( item, quantity, eventual price ). Then we used a variety of vlookup and * code to make it work. My virtual shop now calculates the price of the object my customer wants when all I have to do is enter the quantity, and item. **

**The addition this week however was discount. W discovered the way to create a discount of in my case 56% when you bought 7 items. However, in the 'salmon chino' event, there was a price increase of 400%. There was also a special offer, of 68% discount when you bought seven items, on weekends. Sound to good to be true? It could still cost you £12000000000! Please visit my shop, but only if you plan to spend approximately £14 million.**
