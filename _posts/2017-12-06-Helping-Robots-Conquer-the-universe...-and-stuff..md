Notice anything different? Yep, the bit about what the computer likes to eat! This was a fairly simple piece we learnt today in class.

**favourite = ["salmon","tuna"," and bread"," and human brain tissue"]**

**print(favourite[1])**

**for i in favourite:**

**  print(i)**

**favourite.append("dinner")**

**favourite.sort()**

**print(favourite)**

This basically creates a list, which the computer then recites. Why do this despicable act of horror? Because it's fun.

(P.S the list is not really a  **_despicable act of horror_** )

(not really anyway..)
