This is the last week for two weeks that I shall be submitting a blog, so enjoy the fun while it lasts! 

In the current code (seen above) it should be evident that a series of questions are being asked. Now, for those of you who actually bothered to READ the code above, you would see that I give the reader multiple choices, but choices. This is a key factor because if I didn't use this technique, and used keywords instead, the conversations wouldnâ€™t always make sense, and the responses would be inadequate or inaccurate. By giving the responding party options, they only have a few choices, and I can be prepared for ALL of them. 

I thoroughly recommend this technique, and would also like to recommend using Repl.IT which lets you use a variety of coding techniques.

With that in order, and for the last time before the christmas holidays, 

NOAH
