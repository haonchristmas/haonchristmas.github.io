Random. What on earth is random. Random is a non calculated, unpredictable value. In some cases, it may be a numerical value, but in other cases it could be questions, words and phrases which are all random. Or are they? Truly random does not eliminate the possibility of everything being the same as it was. In simpler terms:

You are listening to an album on a musical website, such as spotify or deezer. You see in the bottom left corner two entwined arrows, and recognise the 'shuffle' button. This will supposedly randomise the music, but this is not the case. If it were truly random, then, despite the small chance of it, all the songs could randomise in the same order that they were to begin with. This is true randomity. However the unfortunate truth is that we picky spotify subscribers can’t handle this phenomenon, and complain to the companies who are affected. This means that now, the ‘shuffle’ button actually applies a formula to make SURE that this does not happen. Thus we have killed the random in our everyday lives.

Please see below, my awesome code:
