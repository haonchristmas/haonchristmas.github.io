**Totally not copying Buzzfeed... or anything**

*So, in today's action packed, high octane lesson… we did a quiz. No, that was not a typo, we did a quiz. Not just any quiz however, as this quiz was important, this quiz was awesome, this quiz was on… *Buzzfeed.* For the slightly more educated readers among you, you will know what buzzfeed is. For the others… too bad. *

*Why did we do a quiz? Well, it was inspiration for our own quizzes! Which can be on anything at all, excluding things which can't be mentioned on my blog (DUH!). So naturally I chose natural disasters. Please see below, the beginning of the fabulous-ness (is that a word???) that is my quiz!*

Which disaster are you most like?

*Tornado, sharknado, earthquake, or hurricane*

Are you tall, skinny, stupid, or loud?

tall=h

skinny=t

stupid=s

loud=e

Are you afraid of roundabouts, guns, skyscrapers, or, planes?

roundy=t

guns=s

skyscrapers=e

planes=h

Are you fast, quick, speedy, or, pacy?

fast=e

quick=t

pacy=h

speedy=s

Would you rather swim, dance, twirl or show off?

swim=s

dance=e

twirl=t

show=h

Do you like doughnuts, sausages, sushi, or, cornflakes?

dough=h

saus=t

sush=s

corn=e

How would your friends describe you?

a)dumb (s)

b)buff (h)

c)lanky (t)

d)flat footed (e)

The method i will use is to look at the number of letters achieved. This means that if somebody chooses more sharknado than tornado options then they would be a sharknado. The questions make sense (ish). The code (or code equivalent) i will use is if s>t return "sharknado". This can be manipulated to fit the other choices.

*Well, thanks for reading, and stuff, so go rip off Buzzfeed! ( I hope i'm allowed to say that?)*

*Many thanks, and wishing you a great week,*
