**A compilation of ninja skills + a little bit of code…**

*So, what have I learnt over the past few weeks? Well, mostly how to rip off buzzfeed, create a creepy AI and to make a shop selling over priced sausages! More than this however,  I learnt not to be afraid to ask for help. And so, to show off my awesome coding skills (and to get a good grade, Mr. Keen I know you're reading this!) here is a compilation of my achievements this year so far!*

*This used a culmination of vlookup,  python knowledge (eg. * = multiply), and general knowledge too. First we needed a list of the items that we were going to sell in our virtual and imaginary shop. Mine included dog soup, jumbo sausages and haggis. Then we needed to add the prices ( which meant that the jumbo sausages cost £4,000,000.00 obviously ). This is important because if there is no price to an object, you will not make any imaginary money, thus ending up imaginarily bankrupt, with imaginarily no jumbo sausage ( devastating!). So add the price, and then we needed to create a virtual till. I used three columns, each representing a factor in working out the price of the items the customer wants ( item, quantity, eventual price ). Then we used a variety of vlookup and * code to make it work. My virtual shop now calculates the price of the object my customer wants when all I have to do is enter the quantity, and item. SIMPLE!*

*Next is the AI, enjoy!*

*In the current code (seen above) it should be evident that a series of questions are being asked. Now, for those of you who actually bothered to READ the code above, you would see that I give the reader multiple choices, but choices. This is a key factor because if I didn't use this technique, and used keywords instead, the conversations wouldn’t always make sense, and the responses would be inadequate or inaccurate. By giving the responding party options, they only have a few choices, and I can be prepared for ALL of them.* Now that we have seen how awesome I am at coding, and how thick and complicated my code is, I am sure that my grade is going to benefit.

Have fun creating your own code, and remember, there is no limit to what you can do if you put your mind to it!*
