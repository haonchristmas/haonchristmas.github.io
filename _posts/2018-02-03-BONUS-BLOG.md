**BONUS BLOG!**

*Aren't you lucky! I have decided to write this bonus blog for my readers, to formally apologise for the lack of blog this week. I was unable to write on the 31st of January because I was not in the IT lesson I usually blog about. This was because of a geography trip, to stratford, to take surveys on the olympic park. Although this was not as fun ( OBVIOUSLY ) as the IT lesson, I did have a good time. *

*Reviewing my previous post, i do apologise for the failed 'embed'. This was the virtual shop area, but it came up with a ‘404 page not found’ thing. I am working on this, and will try to fix it. In the meantime, Happy coding!*
