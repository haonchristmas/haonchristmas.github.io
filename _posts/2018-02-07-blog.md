**REPL.IT CONTINUED**

**So, **despite being absent during the lesson (as I was running for the school cross country) I am still going to write my blog. Repl IT is an advanced code building program which I am using for my 'Buzzfeed quiz'. My quiz is going to test you to see whether you are a sharknado, tornado, hurricane or earthquake. The idea I am using is a manual counting scheme, where your answer will return a number 1-4. At the end of the quiz, the person answering the questions will have to review their numbers. The idea is that the person will then be told whether they are a sharknado, tornado, hurricane or earthquake.

While this method is by far the simplest, it may not be the one that I use. This is because I want to do as well as I can in the project. There are methods where this is done behind the scenes as a procedure. This will return an answer and keep the information. This makes it tidier, and will also make it more advanced. The difference between a procedure and a function is that a function is displayed, and procedures work behind the scene.

Hoping to write after half term,

				Noah
