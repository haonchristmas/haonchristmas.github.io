So, most (if not all) of you are wondering whether I have gone completely crazy, or if i'm onto something. My response is that repl.it has devised the most genius thing in existence, and that is python with turtle. This provides you with a turtle, if you should choose to spawn it. Why wouldnâ€™t you? 

Anyway, the theory behind today's lesson was to draw shapes, and so we did, but using exterior angles.
