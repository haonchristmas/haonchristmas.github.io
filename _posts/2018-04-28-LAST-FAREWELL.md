My Final Farewell

I am very sorry to say that this blog post will be the last blog post in a long time. It may come as a surprise to some of you, but this blog will celebrate it's fourth birthday next september. I am going to stop writing blog posts then. Unless I discover something awesome to share with you, this is it. The last post. I realised this morning that many of you will never understand the name of the blog. That is because I never explained it. HAONCHRISTMAS is my name (Noah) and christmas combined. Although a shallow explanation, it is an explanation. Thankyou to all the people who have helped to make this happen (Mr. K, Mr. T) and of course my Github for the blogging software. And then the biggest thank you of all goes to you, my readers, for making all the blogging possible. I hope you enjoy coding, and have enjoyed reading my blog posts, as much as I have enjoyed writing them. 

And so, in true HAONCHRISTMAS tradition,

Keep coding!

Noah
