**Ok guys,now this really is the last timeâ€¦**

*Sorry to any of the people who have read my previous post! I may have lied, and this is in fact, my last blog post. So. Unfortunately, this is the last post and i just want to display my awesomeness. If you copy the link below, you will see my awesome work. I will write a brief description, but it's easier to look.*

*This is python with turtle, which some of you may remember, and it is really fun. This program is very simple, and if you can remember the functions, you can browse(and hopefully understand) the code next to it!*
